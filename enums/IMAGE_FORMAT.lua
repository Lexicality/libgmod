--- Legacy format. Blue, Green, Red order, 8 bit per pixel.  
_G.IMAGE_FORMAT_BGR888 = 3
--- Red, Green, Blue, 5 bit per pixel for Red and Blue channels, 6 bits for Green. Effectively uses less video memory.

--- Grayscale format (black and white) with alpha support, 8 bits per pixel/channel. Not working on Proton.  
_G.IMAGE_FORMAT_IA88 = 6
--- Unknown legacy format. 8 bit alpha? Same as `I8` besides assigned meaning/name to the channel?
