--- Doesn't collide with the world, but does push and crush entities.  
--- This is what is used by the engine for elevators, trains, doors, moving water, etc.  
--- In order to work properly, the entity needs to have specific Save Values/Internal Variables set which tell it how long it should be moving for.  
--- **Note:** This same process can be done for both position and angle.  
--- 1. You'll need to Get an existing Save Value called `ltime`  
--- 2. Calculate how long (in seconds) the entity will be moving before it reaches its destination.  
--- As a simple example, this can be done via `duration = distance / speed`  
--- 3. Set the Save Value for `m_flMoveDoneTime` to the value you retrieved for `ltime` plus the duration calculated in step 2.  
--- Put more simply: `m_flMoveDoneTime = ltime + duration`  
--- 4. Set the entity's velocity to move it to the destination at the speed used in step 2.  
--- Once the duration of the move has elapsed, the entity will stop moving.  If you have done your calculations correctly, it should stop exactly at the desired destination.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: MOVETYPE_PUSH entities only move during Entity:Think so if you want smooth movement, you need to set Entity:NextThink to Global.CurTime, which instructs the entity to execute Entity:Think as quickly as possible.
