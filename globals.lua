--- This function creates a World Tip, similar to the one shown when aiming at a Thruster where it shows you its force.  
--- This function will make a World Tip that will only last 50 milliseconds (1/20th of a second), so you must call it continuously as long as you want the World Tip to be shown. It is common to call it inside a Think hook.  
--- Contrary to what the function's name implies, it is impossible to create more than one World Tip at the same time. A new World Tip will overwrite the old one, so only use this function when you know nothing else will also be using it.

--- Creates an Angle object, representing a [Euler Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) made up of pitch, yaw, and roll components.  
--- âš  **WARNING**:   
--- This function is relatively expensive, in terms of performance, in situations where it is being called multiple times every frame (Like a loop, for example.) This is due to the overhead associated with object creation and garbage collection.  
--- Where possible, it is generally better to store an Angle in a variable and re-use that variable rather than re-creating it repeatedly.  
--- In cases where an empty Angle is needed, the global variable `angle_zero` is the preferred solution instead of `Angle( 0, 0, 0 )`.  
--- @param pitch number @The pitch value of the angle, in degrees.

--- Creates a Color.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: This function is relatively expensive when used in rendering hooks or in operations requiring very frequent calls (like loops for example) due to object creation and garbage collection. It is better to store the color in a variable or to use the [default colors](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global_Variables#misc) available.

--- An [eagerly evaluated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation) [ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:), or, in layman's terms, a compact "if then else" statement.  
--- In most cases, you should just use Lua's ["pseudo" ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:#Lua), like this:  
--- ```  
--- local myCondition = true  
--- local consequent = "myCondition is true"  
--- local alternative = "myCondition is false"  
--- print(myCondition and consequent or alternative)  
--- ```  
--- In the above example, due to [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation), `consequent` would be "skipped" and ignored (not evaluated) by Lua due to `myCondition` being `true`, and only `alternative` would be evaluated. However, when using `Either`, both `consequent` and `alternative` would be evaluated. A practical example of this can be found at the bottom of the page.  
--- # Falsey values  
--- If `consequent` is "falsey" (Lua considers both `false` and `nil` as false), this will not work. For example:  
--- ```  
--- local X = true  
--- local Y = false  
--- local Z = "myCondition is false"  
--- print(X and Y or Z)  
--- ```  
--- This will actually print the value of `Z`.  
--- In the above case, and other very rare cases, you may find `Either` useful.  
--- @param condition any @The condition to check if true or false.
