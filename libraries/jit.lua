--- Library to work with the [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) functionality of gmod.  
_G.jit = {}
--- A variable containing the target architecture name: `x86`, `x64`, `arm`, `ppc`, `ppcspe`, or `mips`. This will be `x86` or `x64` in GMod.  
--- @return string @The system architecture.
function jit.arch()
end

--- You can attach callbacks to a number of compiler events with jit.attach. The callback can be called:  
--- * when a function has been compiled to bytecode (`"bc"`);  
--- * when trace recording starts or stops (`"trace"`);  
--- * as a trace is being recorded (`"record"`);  
--- * or when a trace exits through a side exit (`"texit"`).  
--- Set a callback with `jit.attach(callback, "event")` and clear the same callback with `jit.attach(callback)`  
--- âš  **WARNING**: This function isn't officially documented on LuaJIT wiki, use it at your own risk.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: Using these constantly (especially bytecode) can be very performance heavy due to the constant stream of data being compiled at a time.  
--- @param callback function @The callback function
--- @param event string @The event to hook into.
function jit.attach(callback, event)
end

--- Flushes the whole cache of compiled code.  
function jit.flush()
end

--- Disables LuaJIT Lua compilation.  
function jit.off()
end

--- Enables LuaJIT Lua compilation.  
function jit.on()
end

--- JIT compiler optimization control. The opt sub-module provides the backend for the -O command line LuaJIT option.  
--- You can also use it programmatically, e.g.:  
--- ```  
--- jit.opt.start(2) -- same as -O2  
--- jit.opt.start("-dce")  
--- jit.opt.start("hotloop=10", "hotexit=2")  
--- ```  
--- A list of LuaJIT -O command line options can be found here(a table of various optimization levels are displayed towards the bottom of the page along with exactly which optimization options are enabled for each level): http://luajit.org/running.html  
--- @vararg any 
function jit.opt.start(...)
end

--- This is NOT a function, it's a variable containing the target OS name: `Windows`, `Linux`, `OSX`, `BSD`, `POSIX` or `Other`.  
--- @return string @The operating system.
function jit.os()
end

--- Returns the status of the JIT compiler and the current optimizations enabled.  
--- @return boolean @Is JIT enabled
--- @return any @Strings for CPU-specific features and enabled optimizations
function jit.status()
end

--- Returns bytecode of a function at a position.

--- @param func function @Function to retrieve bytecode from.
--- @param pos number @Position of the bytecode to retrieve.
--- @return number @bytecode instruction
--- @return number @bytecode opcode
function jit.util.funcbc(func, pos)

--- Retrieves LuaJIT information about a given function, similarly to debug.getinfo. Possible table fields:  
--- * linedefined: as for debug.getinfo

--- * params: the number of parameters the function takes  
--- * stackslots: the number of stack slots the function's local variable use

--- * children: Boolean representing whether the function creates closures  
--- * currentline: as for debug.getinfo  
--- * isvararg: if the function is a vararg function  
--- * source: as for debug.getinfo  
--- * loc: a string describing the source and currentline, like "<source>:<line>"  
--- * ffid: the fast function id of the function (if it is one). In this case only upvalues above and addr below are valid  
--- * addr: the address of the function (if it is not a Lua function). If it's a C function rather than a fast function, only upvalues above is valid*  
--- @param func function @Function or Proto to retrieve info about.
--- @param pos? number 
--- @return table @Information about the supplied function/proto.
