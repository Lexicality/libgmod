--- The input library allows you to gather information about the clients input devices (mouse & keyboard), such as the cursor position and whether a key is pressed or not.  
_G.input = {}

--- @param button number @The button, see Enums/BUTTON_CODE.
--- @return string @Button name.
function input.GetKeyName(button)
end

function input.IsButtonDown(button)
end

function input.IsKeyTrapping()
end

--- Gets whether a mouse button is down  
--- @param mouseKey number @The key, see Enums/MOUSE
--- @return boolean @Is the key down
function input.IsMouseDown(mouseKey)
end

--- Gets whether a shift key is being pressed  
--- @return boolean @isDown
function input.IsShiftDown()
end

--- Returns the client's bound key for the specified console command. If the player has multiple keys bound to a single command, then the key with the lowest Enums/BUTTON_CODE will be returned.  
--- @param binding? string @The binding name
--- @param exact? boolean @True to disable automatic stripping of a single leading `+` character
--- @return string @The first key found with that binding or no value if no key with given binding was found
function input.LookupBinding(binding, exact)
end

--- Returns the bind string that the given key is bound to.  
--- @param key number @Key from Enums/BUTTON_CODE
--- @return string @The bind string of the given key.
function input.LookupKeyBinding(key)
end

--- Switches to the provided weapon on the next CUserCmd generation/CreateMove call. Direct binding to [CInput::MakeWeaponSelection](https://github.com/LestaD/SourceEngine2007/blob/43a5c90a5ada1e69ca044595383be67f40b33c61/se2007/game/client/in_main.cpp#L929-L932).  
--- @param weapon GWeapon @The weapon entity to switch to.
function input.SelectWeapon(weapon)
end

--- Sets the cursor's position on the screen, relative to the topleft corner of the window  
--- @param mouseX number @X coordinate for mouse position
--- @param mouseY number @Y coordinate for mouse position
function input.SetCursorPos(mouseX, mouseY)
end

--- Begins waiting for a key to be pressed so we can save it for input.CheckKeyTrapping. Used by the DBinder.  
function input.StartKeyTrapping()
end

--- Translates a console command alias, basically reverse of the `alias` console command.  
--- @param command string @The alias to lookup.
--- @return string @The command(s) this alias will execute if ran, or nil if the alias doesn't exist.
function input.TranslateAlias(command)
end

--- Returns whether a key was initially pressed in the same frame this function was called.  
--- This function only works in Move hooks, and will detect key presses even in main menu or when a typing in a text field.  
--- @param key number @The key, see Enums/KEY.
--- @return boolean @True if the key was initially pressed the same frame that this function was called, false otherwise.
function input.WasKeyPressed(key)
end

--- Returns whether a key was released in the same frame this function was called.  
--- This function only works in Move hooks, and will detect key releases even in main menu or when a typing in a text field.  
--- @param key number @The key, see Enums/KEY.
--- @return boolean @True if the key was released the same frame that this function was called, false otherwise.
function input.WasKeyReleased(key)
end

--- Returns whether the key is being held down or not.  
--- This function only works in Move hooks, and will detect key events even in main menu or when a typing in a text field.

--- @return boolean @Whether the key is being held down or not.
function input.WasKeyTyped(key)
end

--- Returns whether a mouse key was double pressed in the same frame this function was called.  
--- If this function returns true, input.WasMousePressed will return false.

--- @param button number @The mouse button to test, see Enums/MOUSE
--- @return boolean @Whether the mouse key was double pressed or not.
function input.WasMouseDoublePressed(button)
end

--- Returns whether a mouse key was initially pressed in the same frame this function was called.  
--- If input.WasMouseDoublePressed returns true, this function will return false.  
--- This function only works in Move hooks, and will detect mouse events even in main menu or when a typing in a text field.  
--- @param key number @The key, see Enums/MOUSE
--- @return boolean @True if the mouse key was initially pressed the same frame that this function was called, false otherwise.
function input.WasMousePressed(key)
end

--- Returns whether a mouse key was released in the same frame this function was called.  
--- This function only works in Move hooks, and will detect mouse events even in main menu or when a typing in a text field.
