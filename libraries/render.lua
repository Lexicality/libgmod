--- The render library is a powerful set of functions that let you control how the world and its contents are rendered. It can also be used to draw some 3D clientside effects such as beams, boxes and spheres.  
_G.render = {}

--- For more detailed information on Beams, as well as usage examples, see the Beams Render Reference

--- Blurs the render target ( or a given texture )

--- Captures a part of the current render target and returns the data as a binary string in the given format.  
--- Since the pixel buffer clears itself every frame, this will return a black screen outside of render hooks. To capture the user's final view, use GM:PostRender. This will not capture the Steam overlay or third-party injections (such as the Discord overlay, Overwolf, and advanced cheats) on the user's screen.  
--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [In PNG mode, this function can produce unexpected result where foreground is rendered as transparent.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2571)  
--- This is caused by render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha set to `true` when doing most of render operations, including rendering in `_rt_fullframefb`. If you want to capture render target's content as PNG image only for output quality, set Structures/RenderCaptureData's `alpha` to `false` when capturing render targets with render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha set to `true`.
