--- The debug library is intended to help you debug your scripts, however it also has several other powerful uses. Some builtin debug function were removed in GMod due to security reasons

--- â„¹ **NOTE**:  This only works on the source dedicated server.   
--- Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can inspect global and local variables, change their values, evaluate expressions, and so on. A line containing only the word cont finishes this function, so that the caller continues its execution.  
--- * Commands for debug.debug are not lexically nested within any function, and so have no direct access to local variables.  
--- * To exit this interactive mode, you can press Ctrl + Z then Enter OR type the word 'cont' on a single line and press enter.

--- Returns the current hook settings of the passed thread. The thread argument can be omitted. This is completely different to gamemode hooks. More information on hooks can be found at http://www.lua.org/pil/23.2.html. This function will simply return the function, mask, and count of the last called debug.sethook.

--- Returns the internal Lua registry table.

--- Sets the given function as a Lua hook. This is completely different to gamemode hooks. The thread argument can be completely omitted and calling this function with no arguments will remove the current hook. This is used by default for infinite loop detection. More information on hooks can be found at http://www.lua.org/pil/23.2.html and https://www.gammon.com.au/scripts/doc.php?lua=debug.sethook  
--- Hooks are not always ran when code that has been compiled by LuaJIT's JIT compiler is being executed, this is due to Intermediate Representation internally storing constantly running bytecode for performance reasons.
