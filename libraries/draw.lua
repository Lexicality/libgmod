--- Draws a rounded rectangle.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function actually draws rectangles with 'gui/cornerX' textures applied to it's rounded corners. It means that this function will fail (or will be drawn not as expected) with any vertex operations, such as model matrices like cam.Start3D2D (corners would be pixelated) or stencil operations. Consider using surface.DrawPoly or mesh library  
--- ðŸŸ¥ **NOTE**: Requires a 2D rendering context  
--- @param cornerRadius number @Radius of the rounded corners, works best with a multiple of 2
--- @param x number @The x coordinate of the top left of the rectangle.
--- @param y number @The y coordinate of the top left of the rectangle.
--- @param width number @The width of the rectangle.
--- @param height number @The height of the rectangle.
--- @param color table @The color to fill the rectangle with
function draw.RoundedBox(cornerRadius, x, y, width, height, color)
