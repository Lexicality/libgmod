--- The os library is a standard Lua library originally intended to allow Lua access to various features of the Operating System it's running on, however many of the features and functions have been removed in Garry's Mod due to security issues. It's only used in Garry's Mod for date & time operations.  
_G.os = {}
--- Returns the approximate cpu time the application ran.  
--- See also Global.SysTime  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function has different precision on Linux (1/100).  
--- @return number @runtime
function os.clock()
end

--- Returns the date/time as a formatted string or in a table.  
--- @param format string @The format string
--- @param time? number @Time to use for the format.
--- @return string @Formatted date
function os.date(format, time)
end

--- Subtracts the second from the first value and rounds the result.  
--- @param timeA number @The first value.
--- @param timeB number @The value to subtract.
--- @return number @diffTime
function os.difftime(timeA, timeB)
end

--- Returns the system time in seconds past the unix epoch. If a table is supplied, the function attempts to build a system time with the specified table members.  
--- @param dateData? table @Table to generate the time from
--- @return number @Seconds passed since Unix epoch
function os.time(dateData)
end
