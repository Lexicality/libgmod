--- Used primarily for adding new soundscript entries.  
_G.sound = {}
--- Creates a sound script. It can also override sounds, which seems to only work when set on the server.  
--- You can find a list of common sound scripts that are shipped with the game by default here: Common Sounds.  
--- A list of sound scripts can be retrieved with sound.GetTable.  
--- @param soundData table @The sounds properties
function sound.Add(soundData)
end

--- Overrides sounds defined inside of a txt file; typically used for adding map-specific sounds.  
--- @param filepath string @Path to the script file to load.
function sound.AddSoundOverrides(filepath)
end

--- Emits a sound hint to the game elements to react to, for example to repel or attract antlions.  
--- @param hint number @The hint to emit
--- @param pos GVector @The position to emit the hint at
--- @param volume number @The volume or radius of the hint
--- @param duration number @The duration of the hint in seconds
--- @param owner? GEntity @If set, the sound hint will be ignored/deleted when the given entity is destroyed.
function sound.EmitHint(hint, pos, volume, duration, owner)
end

--- Creates a sound from a function.  
--- @param indentifier string @An unique identified for the sound
--- @param samplerate number @The sample rate of the sound
--- @param length number @The length in seconds of the sound to generate.
--- @param callbackOrData function @A function which will be called to generate every sample on the sound
--- @param loopStart? number @Sample ID of the loop start
function sound.Generate(indentifier, samplerate, length, callbackOrData, loopStart)
end

--- Returns the most dangerous/closest sound hint based on given location and types of sounds to sense.  
--- @param types number @The types of sounds to choose from
--- @param pos GVector @The position to sense sounds at.
--- @return table @A table with SoundHintData structure or `nil` if no sound hints are nearby.
function sound.GetLoudestSoundHint(types, pos)
end

--- Returns properties of the soundscript.  
--- @param name string @The name of the sound script
--- @return table @The properties of the soundscript
function sound.GetProperties(name)
end

--- Returns a list of all registered sound scripts.  
--- New ones can be registered using sound.Add, and detailed information about each one can be retrieved via sound.GetProperties.  
--- @return table @The list/array of all registered sound scripts ( No other information is provided )
function sound.GetTable()
end

--- Plays a sound from the specified position in the world.  
--- If you want to play a sound without a position, such as a UI sound, use surface.PlaySound instead.  
--- This function is similar to Global.EmitSound, but with less options.  
--- @param snd string @The sound to play
--- @param pos GVector @Where the sound should play.
--- @param level? number @Sound level in decibels
--- @param pitch? number @The sound pitch
--- @param volume? number @Output volume of the sound in range 0 to 1.
--- @param dsp? number @The DSP preset for this sound
function sound.Play(snd, pos, level, pitch, volume, dsp)
end

--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [This fails for looping .wav files in 3D mode.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/1752)  
--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [This fails with unicode file names.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2304)  
--- @param path string @The path to the file to play
--- @param flags string @Flags for the sound
--- @param callback function @Callback function that is called as soon as the the stream is loaded
function sound.PlayFile(path, flags, callback)
