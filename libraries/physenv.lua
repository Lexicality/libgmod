--- The physenv library allows you to control the physics environment created by the engine, and lets you modify constants such as gravity and maximum velocity.  
_G.physenv = {}
--- Adds a [material surface property](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Material_surface_properties) type to the game's physics environment.  
--- See util.GetSurfaceData for the opposite function.  
--- ü¶ü **BUG**: [The game has a limit of 128 surface properties - this includes properties loaded automatically from [surfaceproperties.txt](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/scripts/surfaceproperties.txt). Due to this, there's only a small amount of open slots that can be registered with GMod's provided surfaceproperties.txt.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2604)  
--- Does nothing on `x86-64` beta.  
--- @param properties string @The properties to add

--- Returns the air density used to calculate drag on physics objects.  
--- ‚Åâ **VALIDATE**: The unit is in `kg/m¬≥`.  
--- @return number @Default value is 2.

--- Gets the gravitational acceleration used for physics objects in `source_unit/s^2`.  
--- @return GVector @Gravity direction and strength.

--- Returns the last simulation duration of the in-game physics.  
--- @return number @The last simulation duration of the in-game physics in seconds

--- Gets the current performance settings in table form.  
--- @return table @Performance settings or nil if called too early

--- Returns the pause status of global physics simulation. See physenv.SetPhysicsPaused for the setter.  
--- @return boolean @`true` if paused.

--- Sets the air density.  
--- @param airDensity number @The new air density.
