--- The physenv library allows you to control the physics environment created by the engine, and lets you modify constants such as gravity and maximum velocity.

--- Adds surface properties to the game's physics environment.  
--- ü¶ü **BUG**: [The game has a limit of 128 surface properties - this includes properties loaded automatically from [surfaceproperties.txt](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/scripts/surfaceproperties.txt). Due to this, there's only a small amount of open slots that can be registered with GMod's provided surfaceproperties.txt.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2604)
