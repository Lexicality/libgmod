--- Data structure used by the duplicator to store and load entity data.  
--- It is created by duplicator.CopyEntTable and can be loaded by duplicator.CreateEntityFromTable.  
--- It also shows up in several other contexts:  
--- * duplicator.RegisterEntityClass  
--- * ENTITY:OnEntityCopyTableFinish  
--- * ENTITY:OnDuplicated  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: In addition to all fields listed here, any field saved on the entity will be saved as-is to this table. For example, if you set `ent.FavoriteFood = "Steak"` before duplicating it, this structure will also contain the field `FavoriteFood` with the value `"Steak"`.
