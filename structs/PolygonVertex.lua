--- A structure containing vertex information for use with surface.DrawPoly.  
--- UV coordinates describe which part of a given texture should be drawn at a vertex - your graphics card's interpolator will fill in space between vertices. UV coords range from `0-1`, with `0` being top/left and `1` being bottom/right. If you're using a texture these are mandatory.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: You must pass a table of tables with this structure to the function. **You need to pass at least 3 points.**  
--- Your points must be defined in a **clockwise order.** Otherwise, your shape will not render properly.  
--- @class SPolygonVertex
--- @field x number @The x coordinate of the vertex.
--- @field y number @The y coordinate of the vertex.
--- @field u number @The u texture coordinate of the vertex
--- @field v number @The v texture coordinate of the vertex
