--- @class MySQLOOPreparedQuery : MySQLOOQuery
--- A prepared query uses a prepared statement that, instead of having the actual values of
--- new rows, etc. in the query itself, it uses parameters, that can be set using the appropriate methods
--- PreparedStatements make sql injections pretty much impossible since the data is sent seperately from the parameterized query
--- Prepared queries also make it easy to reuse one query several times to insert/update/delete multiple rows
--- An example of a parameterized query would be "INSERT INTO users (`steamid`, `nick`) VALUES(?,?)"
--- A few types of queries might not work with prepared statements
--- For more information about prepared statements you can read here: [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement[/url]
local PreparedQuery = {}

--- Sets the parameter at index (1-based) to be of type double with value number
--- @param index number
--- @param number number
function PreparedQuery:setNumber(index, number)

--- Sets the parameter at index (1-based) to be of type string with value str
--- Note: str should not!! be escaped
--- @param index number
--- @param str string

end

--- Sets the parameter at index (1-based) to be of type boolean with value bool
--- @param index number
--- @param bool boolean
function PreparedQuery:setBoolean(index, bool)

--- Sets the parameter at index (1-based) to be NULL
--- @param index number
function PreparedQuery:setNull(index)
end

--- Clears all currently set parameters inside the prepared statement.
function PreparedQuery:clearParameters()

--- This shouldn't be used anymore, just start the same prepared multiple times with different parameters
function PreparedQuery:putNewParameters()

--- @class MySQLOOTransaction : MySQLOOQuery
--- Transaction object
--- Transactions are used to group several seperate queries or prepared queries together.
--- Either all queries in the transaction are executed successfully or none of them are.
--- Please note that single queries are already transactions by themselves so it usually only makes sense to have transactions
--- with at least two queries.
--- Since mysqloo works async, much of the power of transactions (such as manually rolling back a transaction) cannot be used properly, but
--- there's still many areas they can be useful.
--- Important note: Callbacks of individual queries that are part of the transactions are not run (both in error and successful case). Use the callbacks of the transaction instead.
local Transaction = {}

--- Adds a query to the transaction. The callbacks of the added queries will not be called.
--- query can be either a PreparedQuery or a regular Query
--- @param query MySQLOOQuery
function Transaction:addQuery(query)
end

--- Returns all queries that have been added to this transaction.
--- @return table<number, MySQLOOQuery>
--- @nodiscard
function Transaction:getQueries()
end

--- Called when any of the queries caused an error, no queries will have had any effect
--- @param tr MySQLOOTransaction
--- @param err string
function Transaction.onError(tr, err)
end

--- Called when all queries in the transaction have been executed successfully
function Transaction.onSuccess()

--- @class MySQLOODatabase

--- Connects to the database (non blocking)
--- This function calls the onConnected or onConnectionFailed callback
function Database:connect()

--- This will disable all caching of prepared query handles
--- which will reduce the performance of prepared queries that are being reused
--- Set this to true if you run into the prepared query limit imposed by the server
--- @param cachePreparedStatements boolean

--- Forces the server to wait for the connection to finish. (might cause deadlocks)
