--- Returns true if the projected texture is valid (i.e. has not been removed), false otherwise.  
--- Instead of calling this directly it's a good idea to call Global.IsValid in case the variable is nil.  
--- ```  
--- IsValid( ptexture )  
--- ```  
--- This not only checks whether the projected texture is valid - but also checks whether it's nil.  
--- @return boolean @Whether the projected texture is valid.
function GProjectedTexture:IsValid()
end

--- Removes the projected texture. After calling this, ProjectedTexture:IsValid will return false, and any hooks with the projected texture as the identifier will be automatically deleted.  
function GProjectedTexture:Remove()

--- Sets the angles (direction) of the projected texture.  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.  
--- @param angle GAngle

--- Sets the color of the projected texture.  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.

--- Enable or disable shadows cast from the projected texture.  
--- ℹ **NOTE**: as with all types of projected textures (including the player's flashlight and env_projectedtexture), there can only be 8 projected textures with shadows enabled in total.   
--- This limit can be increased with the launch parameter: -numshadowtextures limit  
---  where limit is the new limit. Naturally, many projected lights with shadows enabled will drastically decrease framerate.  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.

--- Sets the linear attenuation of the projected texture.  
--- See also ProjectedTexture:SetConstantAttenuation and ProjectedTexture:SetQuadraticAttenuation.  
--- The default value of linear attenuation when the projected texture is created is 100. (others are 0, as you are not supposed to mix them)  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.  
--- @param linearAtten number 
function GProjectedTexture:SetLinearAttenuation(linearAtten)
end

--- Sets the distance at which the projected texture begins its projection.  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.  
--- ℹ **NOTE**: Setting this to 0 will disable the projected texture completely! This may be useful if you want to disable a projected texture without actually removing it  
--- ℹ **NOTE**: This seems to affect the rendering of shadows - a higher Near Z value will have shadows begin to render closer to their casting object. Comparing a low Near Z value (like 1) with a normal one (12) or high one (1000) is the easiest way to understand this artifact  
--- @param nearZ number 
function GProjectedTexture:SetNearZ(nearZ)
end

--- Changes the current projected texture between orthographic and perspective projection.  
--- You must call ProjectedTexture:Update after using this function for it to take effect.

--- For animated textures, this will choose which frame in the animation will be projected.
