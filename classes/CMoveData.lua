--- @param impulse number @The impulse to set
function GCMoveData:SetImpulseCommand(impulse)
end

--- Sets the maximum player speed. Player won't be able to run or sprint faster then this value.  
--- This also automatically sets CMoveData:SetMaxSpeed when used in the GM:SetupMove hook. You must set it manually in the GM:Move hook.  
--- This must be called on both client and server to avoid prediction errors.  
--- This will **not** reduce speed in air.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Setting this to 0 will not make the player stationary. It won't do anything.  
--- @param maxSpeed number @The new maximum speed
function GCMoveData:SetMaxClientSpeed(maxSpeed)
end

--- Sets the maximum speed of the player. This must match with CMoveData:SetMaxClientSpeed both, on server and client.  
--- Doesn't seem to be doing anything on it's own, use CMoveData:SetMaxClientSpeed instead.  
--- @param maxSpeed number @The new maximum speed
function GCMoveData:SetMaxSpeed(maxSpeed)
end

--- Sets the serverside move angles, making the movement keys act as if player was facing that direction.
