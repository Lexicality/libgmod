--- @class GCLuaLocomotion
--- This class is essentially what controls a NextBot NPC. You can access it in a NextBot NPC by using **self.loco** variable.  
local GCLuaLocomotion = {}
--- Sets the location we want to get to.  
--- Each call of Approach moves the NextBot 1 unit towards the specified goal. The size of this unit is determined by SetDesiredSpeed; the default is `0` (each call of Approach moves the NextBot 0).  
--- To achieve smooth movement with Approach, it should be called in a hook like Think, as shown in the example.  
--- @param goal GVector @The vector we want to get to.
--- @param goalweight number @If unsure then set this to `1`.
