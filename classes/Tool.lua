function GTool:RebuildControlPanel(...)
end

--- Removes any ghost entity created for this tool.  
--- This is called automatically at various points, including when changing tools, holstering the toolgun, therefore it is a very good idea to implement this callback in your custom tool to cleanup any custom ghost entities.  
function GTool:ReleaseGhostEntity()

--- * Operation 1  
--- * * Stage 1  
--- * * Stage 2  
--- * * Stage 3  
--- * Operation 2  
--- * * Stage 1  
--- * * Stage 2  
--- * * Stage ...  
--- @param operation number @The new operation ID to set.

--- Sets the current stage of the tool. Does nothing clientside.  
--- See also Tool:SetOperation.  
--- @param stage number @The new stage to set.
function GTool:SetStage(stage)
end

--- Initializes the ghost entity based on the supplied entity.  
--- @param ent GEntity @The entity to copy ghost parameters off
function GTool:StartGhostEntity(ent)
end

--- Updates the position and orientation of the ghost entity based on where the toolgun owner is looking along with data from object with id 1 set by Tool:SetObject.  
--- This should be called in the tool's TOOL:Think hook.  
--- This command is only used for tools that move props, such as easy weld, axis and motor. If you want to update a ghost like the thruster tool does it for example, check its [source code](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/gamemodes/sandbox/entities/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/thruster.lua#L179).
