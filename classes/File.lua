--- @class GFile
--- This is the file object. It used used primarily to read or write binary data from files.  
--- The default endianness is little-endian. To use big-endian you will need to provide your own functions to read and write shorts and longs.  
--- The object is returned by file.Open.  
local GFile = {}
--- Dumps the file changes to disk and closes the file handle which makes the handle useless.  
function GFile:Close()
end

--- Returns whether the File object has reached the end of file or not.  
--- @return boolean @Whether the file has reached end or not.
function GFile:EndOfFile()
end

--- Dumps the file changes to disk and saves the file.  
function GFile:Flush()
end

--- Reads the specified amount of chars and returns them as a binary string.  
--- @param length? number @Reads the specified amount of chars
--- @return string 
function GFile:Read(length)
end

--- Reads one byte of the file and returns whether that byte was not 0.  
--- @return boolean @val
function GFile:ReadBool()
end

--- Reads one unsigned 8-bit integer from the file.  
--- @return number @The unsigned 8-bit integer from the file.
function GFile:ReadByte()
end

--- Reads an 8-byte little-endian IEEE-754 floating point double from the file.  
--- @return number @The double-precision floating point value read from the file.
function GFile:ReadDouble()
end

--- Reads an IEEE 754 little-endian 4-byte float from the file.  
--- @return number @The read value
function GFile:ReadFloat()
end

--- Returns the contents of the file from the current position up until the end of the current line.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function will look specifically for `Line Feed` characters `\n` and will **completely ignore `Carriage Return` characters** `\r`.  
--- It will also stop at a `\0` or `NULL` character, but will add a new line instead.  
--- This function will not return more than 8192 characters. The return value will include the `\n` character.  
--- @return string @The string of data from the read line.

--- Moves the file pointer by the specified amount of chars.  
--- @param amount number @The amount of chars to skip, can be negative to skip backwards.
--- @return number @amount
