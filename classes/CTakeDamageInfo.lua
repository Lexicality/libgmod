local GCTakeDamageInfo = {}
--- Increases the damage by damageIncrease.  
--- @param damageIncrease number @The damage to add.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:AddDamage(damageIncrease)
end

--- Returns the ammo type used by the weapon that inflicted the damage.  
--- @return number @Ammo type ID
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetAmmoType()
end

--- Returns the attacker ( character who originated the attack ), for example a player or an NPC that shot the weapon.  
--- @return GEntity @The attacker
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetAttacker()
end

--- Returns the initial unmodified by skill level ( game.GetSkillLevel ) damage.  
--- @return number @baseDamage
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetBaseDamage()
end

--- Returns the total damage.  
--- @return number @damage
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamage()
end

--- Gets the current bonus damage.  
--- @return number @Bonus damage
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamageBonus()
end

--- Gets the custom damage type. This is used by Day of Defeat: Source and Team Fortress 2 for extended damage info, but isn't used in Garry's Mod by default.  
--- @return number @The custom damage type
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamageCustom()
end

--- Returns a vector representing the damage force.  
--- Can be set with CTakeDamageInfo:SetDamageForce.  
--- @return GVector @The damage force
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamageForce()
end

--- Returns the position where the damage was or is going to be applied to.  
--- Can be set using CTakeDamageInfo:SetDamagePosition.  
--- @return GVector @The damage position
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamagePosition()
end

--- Returns a bitflag which indicates the damage type(s) of the damage.  
--- Consider using CTakeDamageInfo:IsDamageType instead. Value returned by this function can contain multiple damage types.  
--- @return number @Damage type(s), a combination of Enums/DMG
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetDamageType()
end

--- Returns the inflictor of the damage. This is not necessarily a weapon.  
--- For hitscan weapons this is the weapon.  
--- For projectile weapons this is the projectile.  
--- For a more reliable method of getting the weapon that damaged an entity, use GetAttacker with GetActiveWeapon.  
--- @return GEntity @The inflictor
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetInflictor()
end

--- Returns the maximum damage. See CTakeDamageInfo:SetMaxDamage  
--- @return number @maxDmg

end

--- Returns the initial, unmodified position where the damage occured.  
--- @return GVector @position
function GCTakeDamageInfo:GetReportedPosition()
end

--- Returns true if the damage was caused by a bullet.  
--- @return boolean @isBulletDmg
function GCTakeDamageInfo:IsBulletDamage()

--- @param scale number @Value to scale the damage with.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:ScaleDamage(scale)
end

--- Changes the ammo type used by the weapon that inflicted the damage.  
--- @param ammoType number @Ammo type ID
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetAmmoType(ammoType)
end

--- Sets the attacker ( character who originated the attack ) of the damage, for example a player or an NPC.  
--- @param ent GEntity @The entity to be set as the attacker.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetAttacker(ent)
end

--- Sets the initial unmodified by skill level ( game.GetSkillLevel ) damage. This function will not update or touch CTakeDamageInfo:GetDamage.  
--- @param arg number @baseDamage
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetBaseDamage(arg)
end

--- Sets the amount of damage.  
--- @param damage number @The value to set the absolute damage to.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamage(damage)
end

--- Sets the bonus damage. Bonus damage isn't automatically applied, so this will have no outer effect by default.  
--- @param damage number @The extra damage to be added.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamageBonus(damage)
end

--- Sets the custom damage type. This is used by Day of Defeat: Source and Team Fortress 2 for extended damage info, but isn't used in Garry's Mod by default.  
--- @param DamageType number @Any integer - can be based on your own custom enums.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamageCustom(DamageType)
end

--- Sets the directional force of the damage.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**:   
--- This function seems to have no effect on player knockback. To disable knockback entirely, see [EFL_NO_DAMAGE_FORCES](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/EFL#EFL_NO_DAMAGE_FORCES) or use workaround example below.  
--- @param force GVector @The vector to set the force to.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamageForce(force)
end

--- Sets the position of where the damage gets applied to.  
--- @param pos GVector @The position where the damage will be applied.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamagePosition(pos)
end

--- Sets the damage type.  
--- @param type number @The damage type, see Enums/DMG.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetDamageType(type)
end

--- Sets the inflictor of the damage for example a weapon.

function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetInflictor(inflictor)
end

--- Sets the maximum damage this damage event can cause.  
--- @param maxDamage number @Maximum damage value.
function GCTakeDamageInfo:SetMaxDamage(maxDamage)
end

--- Sets the origin of the damage.  
--- @param pos GVector @The location of where the damage is originating
