--- @class GPanel
--- This is the base panel for every other [VGUI](vgui) panel.  
--- It contains all of the basic methods, some of which may only work on certain VGUI elements. See also Panel Hooks.  
--- As their functionality is provided at the game's C/C++ level rather than by its Lua script extension, they are unfortunately unavailable for most practical purposes, however, they can still be obtained in a way similar to that provided by the baseclass library:

--- -- Create a new panel type NewPanel that inherits all of its functionality from DLabel,  
--- -- but has a different SetText method than DLabel does - all without the hassle of that  
--- -- old DLabel's default text getting in the way. Fun stuff.  
--- local PANEL = {}

--- â„¹ **NOTE**: On Awesomium, the result remains `true` until the root document is loaded and when in-page content is loading (when adding pictures, frames, etc.). During this state, the HTML texture is not refreshed and the panel is not painted (it becomes invisible).

--- Redefines the panel object's Panel:SetPos method to operate using frame-by-frame linear interpolation (Global.Lerp). When the panel's position is changed, it will move to the target position at the speed defined. You can undo this with Panel:DisableLerp.  
--- Unlike the other panel animation functions, such as Panel:MoveTo, this animation method will not operate whilst the game is paused. This is because it relies on Global.FrameTime.
