--- @class GVector
--- List of all possible functions to manipulate vectors.  
--- Created by Global.Vector.  
--- @field x number @The X component of the vector.
--- @field y number @The Y component of the vector.
--- @field z number @The Z component of the vector.
local GVector = {}
--- Adds the values of the argument vector to the original vector. This function is the same as vector1 + vector2 without creating a new vector object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.  
--- @param vector GVector @The vector to add.
function GVector:Add(vector)
end

--- Returns an angle representing the normal of the vector.  
--- @return GAngle @The angle/direction of the vector.
function GVector:Angle()
end

--- Returns the angle of this vector (normalized), but instead of assuming that up is Global.Vector( 0, 0, 1 ) (Like Vector:Angle does) you can specify which direction is 'up' for the angle.  
--- @param up GVector @The up direction vector
--- @return GAngle @The angle
function GVector:AngleEx(up)
end

--- Calculates the cross product of this vector and the passed one.  
--- The cross product of two vectors is a 3-dimensional vector with a direction perpendicular (at right angles) to both of them (according to the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule)), and magnitude equal to the area of parallelogram they span. This is defined as the product of the magnitudes, the sine of the angle between them, and unit (normal) vector `n` defined by the right-hand rule:  
--- :**a** Ã— **b** = |**a**| |**b**| sin(Î¸) **nÌ‚**  
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors, and **nÌ‚** is a unit vector (magnitude of 1) perpendicular to both.  
--- @param otherVector GVector @Vector to calculate the cross product with.
--- @return GVector @The cross product of the two vectors.
function GVector:Cross(otherVector)
end

--- Returns the squared distance of 2 vectors, this is quicker to call than Vector:Distance as DistToSqr does not need to calculate the square root, which is an expensive process.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Squared distances should not be summed. If you need to sum distances, use Vector:Distance.  
--- When performing a distance check, ensure the distance being checked against is squared. See example code below.  
--- @param otherVec GVector @The vector to calculate the distance to.
--- @return number @Squared distance to the vector.
function GVector:DistToSqr(otherVec)
end

--- Returns the Euclidean distance between the vector and the other vector.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function is more expensive than Vector:DistToSqr. However, please see the notes for Vector:DistToSqr before using it as squared distances are not the same as euclidean distances.  
--- @param otherVector GVector @The vector to get the distance to.
--- @return number @Distance between the vectors.
function GVector:Distance(otherVector)
end

--- Returns the Euclidean distance between the vector and the other vector in 2D space. The Z axis is ignored.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function is more expensive than Vector:Distance2DSqr. However, please see the notes for Vector:Distance2DSqr before using it as squared distances are not the same as Euclidean distances.  
--- @param otherVector GVector @The vector to get the distance to.
--- @return number @Distance between the vectors in 2D space.
function GVector:Distance2D(otherVector)
end

--- Returns the squared distance between 2 vectors in 2D space, ignoring the Z axis. This is faster than Vector:Distance2D as calculating the square root is an expensive process.

--- @param otherVec GVector @The vector to calculate the distance to.
--- @return number @Squared distance to the vector in 2D space.
function GVector:Distance2DSqr(otherVec)
end

--- @param divisor number @The value to divide the vector with.
function GVector:Div(divisor)
end

--- Returns the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Geometric_definition)  of this vector and the passed one.  
--- The dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes (lengths), and the cosine of the angle between them:  
--- **a Â· b** = |**a**| |**b**| cos(Î¸)   
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors.  
--- See Vector:Length for obtaining magnitudes.  
--- A dot product returns just the cosine of the angle if both vectors are normalized, and zero if the vectors are at right angles to each other.  
--- @param otherVector GVector @The vector to calculate the dot product with
--- @return number @The dot product between the two vectors
function GVector:Dot(otherVector)
end

--- ðŸ›‘ **DEPRECATED**: This is an alias of Vector:Dot. Use that instead.

end

function GVector:GetNormal()
end

--- Returns a normalized version of the vector. Normalized means vector with same direction but with length of 1.

--- @return number @Length of the vector.
function GVector:Length()
end

--- Returns the length of the vector in two dimensions, without the Z axis.  
--- âš  **WARNING**:

--- @param multiplier number @The value to scale the vector with.
function GVector:Mul(multiplier)

function GVector:Sub(vector)
end

--- Translates the Vector (values ranging from 0 to 1) into a Color. This will also range the values from 0 - 1 to 0 - 255.  
--- x * 255 -> r  
--- y * 255 -> g  
--- z * 255 -> b  
--- This is the opposite of Color:ToVector

--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [cam.Start3D or 3D context cam.Start with non-default parameters incorrectly sets the reference FOV for this function, causing incorrect return values.
