--- @class DTextEntry : VTextEntry
--- A form which may be used to display text the player is meant to select and copy or alternately allow them to enter some text of their own.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: At least one of your `DTextEntry`'s parents must either be an EditablePanel or derived from it (like a DFrame, for example), else it won't be able to focus and thus be unselectable.  
--- You must also call Panel:MakePopup on said panel or the `DTextEntry` will not work.  
local PANEL = {}

--- Adds an entry to DTextEntry's history.  
--- See DTextEntry:SetHistoryEnabled.  
--- @param text string @Text to add to the text entry's history.
function PANEL:AddHistory(text)
end

--- Called whenever the value of the panel has been updated (whether by user input or otherwise).  
--- It allows you to determine whether a user can modify the TextEntry's text.  
--- By default, this only checks whether the panel disallows numeric characters, preventing it from being edited if the value contains any.  
--- This is actually an engine hook that only works on TextEntry derived elements.  
--- If you are looking for a way to modify character limits, see Panel:SetMaximumCharCount  
--- @param char string @The last character entered into the panel.
--- @return boolean @Return `true` to prevent the value from changing, `false` to allow it.
function PANEL:AllowInput(char)
end

--- Returns whether a string is numeric or not.  
--- Always returns false if the DTextEntry:SetNumeric is set to false.  
--- @param strValue string @The string to check.
--- @return boolean @Whether the string is numeric or not.
function PANEL:CheckNumeric(strValue)
end
