--- @class DScrollPanel : DPanel
--- DScrollPanel is a VGUI Element similar to DPanel however it has a vertical scrollbar docked to the right which can be used to put more content in a smaller area. DScrollPanels are essentially DPanels with the Scroll Bar.  
--- This can be used to replace the DPanelList with DPanelList:EnableVerticalScrollbar and get similar functionality as well as using a non-deprecated element.  
--- If you would like to paint or edit the elements of the scrollbar use DScrollPanel:GetVBar. If you want to see if the scrollbar is visible then use the VBar.Enabled variable on the scrollbar's VBar.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Panel:DockPadding will not have an effect on children of this panel. Use the function on DScrollPanel:GetCanvas instead.
